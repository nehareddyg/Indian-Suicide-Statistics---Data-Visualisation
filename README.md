# Indian-Suicide-Statistics---Data-Visualisation

Our goal was to analyse and visualise the suicide data based on causes, demography etc. chronologically to find
interesting and useful insights. The analysis and visualisations can help the medical institutions
and Governments in understanding the existing scenario and in devising better suicide preventive
interventions. For this purpose, We used a dataset which contained information about the number of suicides in each state in India, classified according to various parameters
(suicide causes, education status, by means adopted, professional profile, social status) from
2001-2012 by the ​ National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), Govt of India​.

Refer to the file [Report.pdf](https://github.com/nehareddyg/Indian-Suicide-Statistics---Data-Visualisation/blob/master/Report.pdf) for more details.

The tools that we haved used for data visualization are: D3.js, dimple.js 

For data analysis, we have used R scripts and Tableau.
